# EZ Maintenance

Just a simple one page maintenance server based on nginx and a maintenance page.

[Nginx at Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/)

The [maintenance page gist](https://gist.github.com/rubyisbeautiful/4945fa431d18c8703f888c8dfc9af3a9) is mine but it is forked and only slightly modified 
from [the original](https://gist.github.com/pitch-gist/2999707)
